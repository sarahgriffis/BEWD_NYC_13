# Object-oriented programming in multiple classes
#
# This file is the "runner" for a program that manages apartments, their
# renters and the buildings that they are located in.
#
# Below this line are three `require_relative` statements, which take the code
# from those files and make them accessible to this file. Your job is to read
# this file, and fix all of the errors that occur. You will need to populate
# the contents of the files inside the lib/ folder.
#
# Start by running this file with `ruby building_manager.rb` inside of your
# terminal. You will get an error. Find the line that the error occurred on and
# debug your way through populating the contents of the three classes in lib/.
# There is no need to edit anything in this file.
